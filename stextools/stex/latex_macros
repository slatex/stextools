# SIGNATURES OF LATEX MACROS AND ENVIRONMENTS (STEX IN SEPARATE FILE)
#
# Macros/environments can be added here to extend the latex parser used by stextools
# It also contains rules of what macros/environments should be recursively considered for annotation
# You can add extend the list locally by adding a file ~/.config/stextools/latex_macros
#
# By default, macro and environment arguments are not searched for annotations,
# but the content of environments is searched.
#
# Examples:
# - "\mcc[{,1:feedback,2" indicates that
#       * the macro `\mcc` has two arguments, the first one optional,
#       * the first argument has key/value pairs and the value of the key `feedback` should be considered for annotation
#       * the second argument should be considered for annotation
# - "\begin{lstlisting}[,norec" indicates that
#       * the environment `lstlisting` has one optional argument
#       * the content of the environment should NOT be considered for annotation (`norec`)
# - "\inputref*[{" indicates that
#       * the macro `\inputref` has one optional argument and one mandatory argument
#       * the macro may be used with or without the star
#       * neither argument should be considered for annotation
