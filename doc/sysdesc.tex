\section{Introduction}
Arguably, dealing with large document collections is one of the key factors in the
knowledge-driven society and economy. There are currently two main contenders for machine
support in this area. Symbolic/logic-based technologies and sub-symbolic,
machine-learning-based AI, e.g. via LLMs or chatbots; they have complementary strengths
and challenges: Symbolic technologies offer precision and explainability out of the box,
but face scalability challenges, because the prerequisite background knowledge has to be
(manually) formalized. ML-based approaches can be trained on all data of the Internet, but
face challenges in precision and explanations. Aarne Ranta matches these profiles to the
notion of \textbf{producer tasks} -- i.e. tasks where precision is key, but limited
coverage ($10^{3\pm1}$ concepts) is OK; e.g. for multi-language/variant manuals for very
expensive tool machines -- and \textbf{consumer tasks}, where coverage is key and
precision secondary; e.g. for consumer-grade machine translation like \textsf{Google
  translate} in \cite{Ranta:atcp17}.

In this paper, we address tools that help attack the coverage problem in symbolic/semantic
approaches in practice. The producer task we use as a case study is that of adaptive
learning assistants for MINT subjects, concretely the \ALeA system
\cite{BerBetChu:lssmkm23}, which uses \sTeX \cite{MueKo:sdstex22,sTeX:github:on} -- a
variant of {\LaTeX} that allows to embed semantic annotations -- for a knowledge
representation and generates learner-adaptive learning objects instrumented with
learning-support interactions from that. The \textbf{\sTeX/\ALeA content commons}
\ednote{MK@MK: continue to describe the size and distribution, and authorship}

We contend that while education -- especially higher education -- as a whole is a
wide-coverage task for society education of individual learners in specific domains --
especially, if we want to tailor the educational offerings to said individual/domain -- is
a producer task, at least until ML-based methods reach the precision and explainability
required by the ethics of teaching.

\section{Semantic Authoring in a Content Common}

The main practical problem of annotating presentational {\LaTeX} course materials into
semantic documents that carry enough information to support meaningful learning support
services is to reference 


\sTeX authoring is already supported by an VSCode IDE plugin \cite{sTeX-IDE:git} that
analyzes annotations on the fly, displays the underlying reference semantics, reports
errors and redundancies, and even offers a concept search interface. 

\section{Conclusion}

In this system description we have presented the \srf tool, a command-line tool
